                    7/11/20: I dreamt that my high school was invaded my zombies. Then I went home,
                drank a Pepsi, and became a zombie.

                    5/26/20: Dreamt about magic sand. It was apparently a fated tradition for two kids to
                    play with the magic sand. My cousin Leo and me were both chose apparently i guess idk.
                    I had visions that the sand tore us apart. This probably stems from the amount of
                    Naruto I've watched.

                    5/20/20: Dreamt that I tried astral projecting. I kept waking up in my dream to another
                    dream, each time attempting it again. In one dream, I left my body, collapsed on the floor,
                    saw a cat looking thing on my dresser, then woke up.
