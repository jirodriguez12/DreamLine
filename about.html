                   This website serves as a dream journal for my little sister and I.
                    Aside from acting as a storage unit for our dreams, it doesn't have much
                    other use. The post button may seem alluring, but it doesn't work yet.
                    It only stores data temporarily, not permanently, preventing this website from becoming
                    a dynamic project. Once it works, this website will be a lot more accessible and a lot
                    easier to use. That's all for now! Goodnight.
